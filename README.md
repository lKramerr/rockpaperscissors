# Rock, Paper Scissors!
#### Made with react-native

This is my first own-made app with react-native. It's quite simple but fun!. I made it in order to prove and challenge my begginer abilities with react-native.

## How it works

1. Choose one "tool" to play (rock, paper, scissors).
2. Tap on the "Play" button below.
3. Wait 3 seconds.
4. The app will compare your choose with the machine one and will select the winner base on the game herarchy. You can see a "You Win!, "Tie!" or "You Loose!" message on the bottom of the screen.

## Knowledge

I put in practice my begginer level on react-native, using the basic functionality for components (custom components, props), hooks and styles, as well as react-native-vector-icons for the icons.

Despiste its simpleness, I have fun making this game. I'm still learning new things every day so I'll upload more complex apps and games in a future! :)
